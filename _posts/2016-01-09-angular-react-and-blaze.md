description: "Late last year I posted a message about how MDG was thinking about the view layer and where we thought we should go next. Since then, we've had many more conversations, both here on the forum, with the Customer Advisory Board we formed last year, and 1:1 with teams ranging from large production users to Meteor non-users, and in environments ranging from small startups to large enterprises."
