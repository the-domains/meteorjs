_There is no application architecture in Meteor._

We just build apps. Sometimes apps are heavily based on a few packages rather than following a core set of principles that will last for a long time.

Now it's worse. We have Blaze/Blaze2, React and Angular. Even inside React, we've a lot of ways to build an app. Then, we are not sure how to fit them with Meteor.

That's why Meteor needs **an **application architecture based on a set of core principles.
